                    According to a recent study conducted at the University of Reading in 2023, record-high ocean temperatures could become the norm if the world's climate warms by 3.0°C above pre-industrial levels.
                    From March 2023, the North Ocean experienced exceptionally warm temperatures that surpassed anything seen in the previous 40 years. As of August 2023, the North Atlantic was 1.4°C warmer than the average in the years 1982-2011.
                    Last year's exceptional ocean conditions were close to what scientists expect to see on average if global warming hits 3°C. Global temperatures have risen by around 1.2°C since pre-industrial levels.

                    New research published this month in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society investigates the causes of 2023's record-breaking ocean temperatures.
                    The study was led by Dr. Till Kuhlbrodt from the University of Reading, and he went on to say: "The extraordinary heat in the North Atlantic and missing sea ice in the Southern Ocean in 2023 tell us the oceans are sounding an alarm. 
                    We urgently need to understand exactly why parts of the ocean are warming rapidly so we can prepare for more frequent weather disruption across the planet. How often we get hit by more of these extremes hangs on figuring out what's driving the Atlantic and Southern Oceans into uncharted territory."

                <p>
                    The findings of the study suggests that Earth's energy imbalance is most certainly a major cause of severe ocean temperatures, as the planet currently absorbs more than 1.9 watts per square meter more solar energy than it reflects back into space as heat. 
                    Over the course of a year, this is nearly 300 times the worldwide yearly usage of electricity.This imbalance has rapidly increased in recent decades, owing primarily to heat-trapping gases produced by human activities. This growing energy surplus is driving ocean warming, with more than 90% of the excess energy collected by Earth being directed into the oceans.
                    Since 2016, the Atlantic Ocean has warmed faster than other ocean basins in the top 100 metres of water. 
                    According to the study, increased Atlantic warming could be connected to record low amounts of sea ice in the Southern Ocean.
                    The rapid warming of the Atlantic ocean is linked with a significant decrease in sea ice cover around Antarctica. 
                    In 2023, Antarctic winter sea ice extent hit its lowest point since satellite monitoring began in the late 1970s.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The researchers highlight the importance of quantifying the impact of rapid Atlantic warming on sea ice coverage. Consistently attributing marine and sea ice extremes will allow climate models to reliably anticipate future extremes, informing mitigation and resilience strategies around the world.
                    He added: "We need more data from the Atlantic to conclusively tie the warming and disappearing ice trends to a shift in the pattern of ocean currents, but the signals point to a hidden climate connections between the poles."
                    Nevertheless, as temperatures continue to rise, it is expected that we take decisive action to address the root causes of ocean warming and protect the fragile ecosystems that depend on healthy seas.
                    By working together to mitigate the effects of ocean warming, we can build a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet and all its inhabitants.
