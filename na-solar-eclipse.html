                    The long-awaited spectacle of the total solar eclipse, dubbed the Great North American Eclipse, finally unfolded on April 8th, 2024.
                    All of North America and Central America experienced a partial solar eclipse but only those within the path of totality—an approximately 185-kilometer wide route through Mexico, 15 U.S. States and Canada—
                    were able to see the moon entirely cover the sun's disk, according to NASA.
                    Firstly, A solar eclipse happens when a new moon passes directly between Earth and the sun, casting its shadow on Earth.
                    It occurs when the moon appears in the sky at the same size as the sun, or somewhat larger, and completely covers the sun's disk, allowing observers to see the sun's outer atmosphere, the corona. 
                    The moon's apparent size in the sky, as well as its ability to totally cover the sun's disk during an eclipse, is determined by its distance from Earth. 
                    The moon orbits Earth in a somewhat elliptical pattern, so it is farthest (apogee) and closest (perigee) to Earth at two points each month, making it appear slightly smaller and larger than usual in our sky. 
                    According to EclipseWise, the new moon looked relatively large and, therefore, covered 100% of the sun's disk as viewed from the narrow path of totality that stretched from Sinaloa, Mexico through the U.S. to Newfoundland, Canada.

                <p>
                    Reporting on the movement of the eclipse, the Moon's complete shadow, casting a path of totality where the Sun was entirely obscured, stretched from the Pacific to the Atlantic. 
                    The journey began over the South Pacific Ocean, with the first touch of totality on mainland North America gracing Mexico's Pacific coast around 11:07 AM (PDT).
                    From Mexico, the eclipse's shadow marched eastward, painting a ribbon of darkness across the United States. 
                    States along the path, from Texas all the way to Maine, witnessed a breathtaking total eclipse for a brief period.  
                    Partial eclipses were visible throughout the contiguous 48 states.

                <p>
                    The inky blackness of totality wasn't the only marvel. 
                    During this phase, the scorching heat of the Sun dipped, and the surrounding landscape took on an ethereal twilight glow.  
                    Some observers even reported seeing the faint corona, the Sun's outer atmosphere, during this fleeting moment.
                    Canada also got its turn under the eclipse's shadow. Southern Ontario marked the entry point, and the path continued through Quebec, gracing several provinces before exiting continental North America on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland.

                <p>
                    While totality was only visible along a narrow path, the excitement for the eclipse gripped all of North America.  
                    Millions gathered in designated viewing areas, equipped with special solar filters to witness this celestial event safely. 
                    Social media buzzed with anticipation and awe-inspiring photos and videos as the eclipse unfolded.
                    It is said that the next solar eclipse will be an annular solar eclipse on Oct 2, 2024, and will be visible over parts of the Pacific Ocean, southern Chile and southern Argentina.
                    Regardless, the Great North American Eclipse of April 2024 was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many, and tt provided a glimpse into the wonders of our solar system, which served as a reminder of the awe-inspiring power of nature.
