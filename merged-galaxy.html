                    This new NASA Hubble Space Telescope image shows ESO 185-IG013, a luminous blue compact galaxy (BCG). 
                    BCGs are nearby galaxies that show an intense burst of star formation. 
                    They are unusually blue in visible light, which sets them apart from other high-starburst galaxies that emit more infrared light. 
                    Astrophysicists study BCGs because they provide a relatively close-by equivalent for galaxies from the early universe. 
                    This means that BCGs can help scientists learn about galaxy formation and evolution that may have been happening billions of years ago.

                    First of all, galaxies merging together are a fundamental process in the evolution of galaxies. 
                    The merge rate of galaxies has been studied extensively, and it has been found that massive galaxies undergo multiple major merges over time, with most of the activity occurring at higher redshifts, according to a paper by Conselice in 2006. 
                    These merges can lead to the formation of gas-rich dwarf galaxies, as evidence suggests that some of these dwarf galaxies are formed from material liberated by galaxy collisions and/or mergers. 
                    The process of galaxy merging involves gravitational interactions and friction between galaxies, which are statistically dominant physical mechanisms responsible for cluster galaxy evolution (Okazaki & Taniguchi, 2000).
                    Moreover, Kronberg et al. (2006) also suggests that the merging of galaxies can cause morphological changes in galaxies, such as distortions in the velocity fields of galaxies and the formation of plumes in head-on collisions, where the halo of the intruder is stripped, and dispersed particles form a broad stellar bridge connecting the two galaxies.
                    These interactions can also trigger substantial star formation in galaxies, representing the main physical processes that lead to enhanced star formation.

                    In this recent news, Hubble imaged ESO 185-IG013 in ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths to reveal details about its past. Hundreds of young star clusters, many of which are younger than 100 million years, populate the galaxy. 
                    A large number of star clusters are only 3.5 million years old – relative infants compared to the timescale of our universe. Scientists predict that many of these youngest clusters will not last, since young clusters can often perish after expelling too much of their gas. 
                    The large number of young star clusters indicates that this galaxy was part of a recent galaxy collision and merger. 
                    ESO 185-IG013 also contains a tidal shell, the diffuse glow surrounding its bright center, which is a common signal of galaxy mergers. 
                    Scientists believe that in a galaxy merger, the smaller of the two interacting galaxies gets disrupted by the larger galaxy, losing most of its material. 
                    This releases the material, which then gets pulled in again by the gravity of the larger galaxy. 
                    The dense area where the material gets repositioned is called the shell, and it contains many star clusters. In addition to the shell, ESO 185-IG013 boasts a tail of gas in the northeast.

                    All of the stars in the system have a combined mass of more than 7 billion times that of our sun. 
                    To think that the system is located about 260 million light-years away, it is marvelous how Hubble is still able to see this kind of phenomenon, albeit old.
