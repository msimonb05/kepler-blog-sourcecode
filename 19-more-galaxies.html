                    The James Webb Space Telescope has taken stunning photos of 19 spiral galaxies in unparalleled clarity, never seen previously by astronomers. 
                    Astronomers believe that spiral galaxies account for roughly 60% of all galaxies, with our solar system located in one of the Milky Way's spiral arms. 
                    “Webb’s new images are extraordinary,” said Janice Lee, a project scientist for strategic initiatives at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, according to NASA.
                    “They’re mind-blowing even for researchers who have studied these same galaxies for decades. Bubbles and filaments are resolved down to the smallest scales ever observed, and tell a story about the star formation cycle.”
                    The images were made public on Monday by a team of scientists involved in a project called Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) that operates across several major astronomical observatories.

                    Looking back a few years ago, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was launched in 2021 and began collecting data in 2022, reshaping the understanding of the early universe while taking wondrous pictures of the cosmos. 
                    The orbiting observatory looks at the universe mainly in the infrared. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990 and still operational, has examined it primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.
                    Spiral galaxies, resembling enormous pinwheels, are a common galaxy type, and our very own Milky Way is one.
                    These new observations came from Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). 
                    They show roughly 100,000 star clusters and millions or perhaps billions of individual stars.
                    The closest of the 19 galaxies is called NGC 5068, about 15 million light years from Earth, and the most distant of them is NGC 1365, about 60 million light years from Earth. 
                    For reference, a light year is the distance light travels in a year, which is 5.9 trillion miles (or 9.5 trillion kilometers).

                    Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) data spotlights glowing dust, unveiling regions where stars are still forming, encased in the gas and dust that nurture their growth.
                    The images also unveil large, spherical shells in the gas and dust, possibly created by exploding stars that carved out colossal voids in the interstellar material.
                    One of the most surprising revelations is the identification of extended regions of gas in red and orange hues along the spiral arms. Described as cosmic waves, the spacing of these structures provides crucial insights into how galaxies distribute their essential elements—gas and dust—affecting the processes of star formation.
                    The telescope’s sharp gaze into the interior of galaxies reveals a captivating pattern. Star formation commences at the core and spirals outward along the arms. 
                    Older stars populate the regions near the galaxy’s core, appearing as if illuminated by a blue spotlight, while younger stars take the center stage further out.
                    Galaxy cores adorned with pink-and-red diffraction also spikes signal the possible presence of active supermassive black holes. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing that seems to be apparent from these 19 spiral galaxy images is that galaxies appear to grow from the inside out, meaning the birth of stars starts at the hearts of galaxies then radiates outwards through those spiral arms. 
                    This means that the further from a galaxy's core a star is the more likely it is to be relatively young with ancient stars mostly gathered at the hearts of galaxies.
                    Either way, the more we see other galaxies light years away from the lens of JWST, the more we may be able to uncover the unfathomable age of our universe.
