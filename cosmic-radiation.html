                    When we think of the sun, we often envision its warm rays and life-giving light. 
                    But beyond its visible glow lies a phenomenon with far-reaching implications: cosmic radiation. 
                    In this blog, we'll explore what cosmic radiation is, how it originates, why the sun emits it, and the potential risks it poses to both individuals and society as a whole. 
                    Additionally, we'll delve into the differences between cosmic radiation and UV rays from the sun and examine whether they are related to each other.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cosmic radiation refers to high-energy particles streaming through space, originating from sources across the universe. 
                    It is a type of natural background radiation that originates in outer space and consists of penetrating ionizing radiation (both particle and electromagnetic). 
                    The sun and stars emit a constant stream of cosmic radiation to Earth, similar to a steady shower of rain. 
                    These particles can include protons, electrons, and even atomic nuclei.
                    Unlike the sun's visible light, cosmic radiation is invisible to the naked eye and can penetrate Earth's atmosphere with ease.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The origins of cosmic radiation are diverse. Some particles are produced by cosmic events like supernovae explosions or the collisions of massive stars. 
                    Others come from sources within our solar system, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun. 
                    These events accelerate particles to incredible speeds, propelling them across vast distances of space.
                    The sun, meanwhile, plays a significant role in the generation of cosmic radiation.
                    According to Biniek et al. (2012), the sun emits cosmic radiation due to various interactions with solar radiation, including UV radiation, solar flares, and inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with the solar radiation field. 
                    These particles travel through the solar system, with some directed towards Earth. While our planet's magnetic field provides some protection, certain particles can penetrate the atmosphere and reach the surface.
                    Furthermore, this emission is expected to come in two components: a stellar disk emission and an extended halo emission, where the high density of thermal photons in the surroundings of stars serves as targets for cosmic-ray electrons, which upscatter them to the gamma-ray domain.
                    The sun periodically diverts some cosmic rays from directly entering the earth's atmosphere, thereby reducing cloud formation (Menezes et al., 2021).
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While cosmic radiation is a natural phenomenon, prolonged exposure can pose risks to human health and technological infrastructure. For astronauts traveling beyond Earth's protective atmosphere, cosmic radiation presents a significant hazard, increasing the risk of cancer and other health problems. 
                    Additionally, cosmic radiation can interfere with sensitive electronics, posing a threat to satellites, spacecraft, and communication systems.
                    Not to be confused with ultraviolet (UV) rays, are a form of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun. Unlike cosmic radiation, which consists of high-energy particles, UV rays are a type of light radiation. 
                    While both UV rays and cosmic radiation originate from the sun, they differ in their composition and effects. 
                    UV rays primarily affect the skin and can cause sunburn, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer. 
                    Cosmic radiation, on the other hand, penetrates deeper into the body and—as serious as it may sound—poses risks to internal organs and DNA.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By understanding the origins and impacts of cosmic radiation and UV rays, we gain insight into the complex interplay between the sun and our planet. 
                    While UV rays affect our everyday lives, cosmic radiation presents unique challenges for space exploration and technological infrastructure. 
                    By studying these phenomena, we can better protect ourselves and our environment from the sun's influence, ensuring a safer and more resilient future for all.
